#  AI-Driven Credit Risk Platform


A full-stack machine learning system that helps financial institutions assess credit risk and predict loan defaults in real time.

 **Live Demo:** [credit-risk-mlops.vercel.app](https://credit-risk-mlops.vercel.app)  
 **API Docs:** [ai-credit-risk-platform-production.up.railway.app/docs](https://ai-credit-risk-platform-production.up.railway.app/docs)

##  What It Does

Users can input a customer's financial data and instantly receive:
- A **risk level** (Low / Medium / High)
- A **default probability score**
- A **verdict** and **recommendation** for loan officers

This helps financial institutions make faster, data-driven lending decisions while reducing default rates.

##  Features

-  Real-time credit risk prediction via REST API
- Stacking ensemble model (XGBoost + Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression)
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- MLflow experiment tracking and model versioning
- Interactive 3-page frontend (Home, Predict, Dashboard)
- Prediction history and risk distribution charts
- Model performance dashboard (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1, Precision, Recall)
- Fully deployed — backend on Railway, frontend on Vercel
